    <p> The Apple Harvest Festival will have diverse farm stands full of fresh, locally grown apples, ranging in large varities of apples to try. Other unique apple varities such as ciders, cider donuts, baked goods and many other goods will also be provided by our amazing local businesses.  Along with mouth watering apple goods, there will also be a number of delicious food trucks and other eateries available to smell and taste. Last but certainly not least, numerous talented local performers/entertainers will also make an appearance throughout the festival who will make the festival all that more enjoyable to see and listen. </p>
