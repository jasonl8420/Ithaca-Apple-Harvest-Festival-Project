    <p> In addition to the list of amazing performances and activities by local bands and groups, another hidden treasure of the Apple Fest are the street performers. Although they won't be easy to come across as they don't perform on the stage, they can often be found scattered across the festival playing style of music unique to each of their own. It is a great way to not only heighten the experience at the festival, but also foster interactions with local performers and other participants as a group, same way other performances and activities do.  </p>
