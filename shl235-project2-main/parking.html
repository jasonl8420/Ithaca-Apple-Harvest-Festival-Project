    <p> Don't want to deal with the hassle of finding parking spots? Don't worry! Ride TCAT from any of the bus stops to downtown. Green Street and Seneca Street bus stations are part of many major TCAT routes. As an alternative, utilize Ithaca Park n' Ride spots located in the main lot of Wegmans and ride TCAT downtown.
